# Real-time-data-pipeline-aws-databricks
A real-time data pipeline project integrating AWS Kinesis, Databricks, and Delta Lake to process and analyze streaming data with a scalable, cloud-native architecture.
This solution simulates real-time data ingestion (sensor readings or financial transactions), processes it using Spark Structured Streaming on Databricks, and stores it in a Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) using Delta Lake.

Includes data visualization with Power BI or Streamlit, and failure monitoring with AWS CloudWatch.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Features:**
- Real-time data ingestion with AWS Kinesis Data Streams
- Stream processing with Databricks Spark Structured Streaming
- Data lakehouse implementation using Delta Lake and Medallion Architecture
- Real-time dashboards and alerts for operational monitoring
- Cloud-native, scalable, and resilient architecture design

ðŸŽ¯ **Business Impact:**  
Enables organizations to make real-time, data-driven decisions by processing high-velocity data streams with reliability and governance.

**Tech Stack:** AWS Kinesis, Databricks, Delta Lake, Python, Spark, CloudWatch, Power BI / Streamlit
